# Family
We’re a Web3 Brand integrating LUKSO's new LSP standards with our luxury-streetwear garments. Using LUKSO's new NFT standards, we'll be able to add provenance and royalties to our physical products.

We’ve also created a Phygital marketplace, where the LUKSO community can safely trade phygital assets created in the LUKSO ecosystem

# How Family Works

Ordering/Minting NFT:

Community members will purchase the Phygitals on our Store where they can use fiat/crypto as payment since we’re using shopify’s backend (Our hackathon submission is only a test run so we'll be doing a normal mint). Our shopify is integrated with our 3PL where the physical garments will be automatically delivered from

Marketplace: 

Community members can then use our marketplace to safely trade/sell their Phygital assets. We’ve added an escrow feature on our marketplace to act as middleman between two parties whilst the physical garment is in transit to the buyer

This escrow smart contract will implement our Royalties utility and also update the “History” metadata of our NFTs

# Hackathon MVP
This hackathon submission is simply a MVP, with still alot of things missing:
- "Create" Feature: Allows the LUKSO community to create their own phygital collection using our resources and infrastructure

- UX/UI Design: Website and mobile app will be redesigned to match our branding

- Garment Identifiers Interaction: Our unique identifiers attached to the garment will be integrated with our infrastructure to further minimise counterfeits from entering our ecosystem

- Chat Feature: A chat function will be added to allow community members to communicate to each other during a trade

- Building Shopify Plugin: Since the LUKSO team is busy with the mainnet launch, we’ll be building out LUKSO’s shopify plugin so that we can use it for our minting page on mainnet launch

- "Auction" Feature: We’ll allow community members to auction their phygital assets in the near future

- Using other NFTs/Tokens as payment: Allow community members to use other forms of payment apart from $LYX


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
