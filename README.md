We’re a Web3 Brand integrating LUKSO's new LSP standards with our luxury-streetwear garments to add provenance and royalties to our products.

We’ve also created a Phygital marketplace, where the LUKSO community can safely trade phygital assets created in the LUKSO ecosystem

# How Family Works
Ordering/Minting NFT:

Community members will purchase the NFTs on our Store where they can use fiat/crypto as payment since we’re using shopify’s backend (Our hackathon submission is only a test run so we'll be doing a normal mint). Our shopify is integrated with our 3PL where the physical garments will be automatically delivered from

Marketplace: 

Community members can then use our marketplace to safely trade/sell their Phygital assets. We’ve added an escrow feature on our marketplace to act as middleman between two parties whilst the physical garment is in transit to the buyer

This escrow smart contract will implement our Royalties utility and also update the “History” metadata of our NFT.
